# Business Clarity Module

## Goal

Turn unstructured business input into a clear, decision‑ready brief.

## Structured outputs

- **Problem statement:** One clear sentence summarizing the issue.
- **Decision & success metric:** The decision to be made and how success will be measured.
- **Assumptions & constraints:** Key assumptions and operational constraints.
- **Data gaps / next questions:** 3–5 prioritized follow‑up questions when data is missing.
- **Recommended approach / framework:** Suggested method or framework to resolve the decision.

## Example workflow

1. User pastes meeting notes or types a freeform question.
2. System extracts intent and produces the problem statement + decision.
3. System lists assumptions and identifies data gaps (3–5 next questions).
4. System recommends a pragmatic approach and an immediate next step (e.g., run X report, instrument Y event).

## Notes for migration

- Keep layout consistent with Use Cases page: Goal → Outputs → Workflow → CTA.
- Use the same H2/H3 sizing and spacing that ProductsPage and UseCasesPage use.
- Reuse existing product card styles for the three module cards; change copy and links to module anchors (business-clarity, analytics-translator, ml-readiness).
