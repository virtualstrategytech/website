        1.0 Introduction
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-blue-100 mb-4">
        The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has irrevocably
        changed how businesses operate and compete. In today's environment,
        small business strategy consulting firms can no longer rely solely on
        traditional expertise. Instead, they must augment their human capital
        with advanced skills that harness AI's potential. One emerging area of
        importance is prompt engineering - a discipline that focuses on crafting
        effective queries and instructions to maximize the output quality of AI
        systems such as ChatGPT. This paper argues that small business strategy
        consulting firms should invest in upskilling their human resources in
        prompt engineering techniques and deploying automation agents. This
        discussion draws upon recent research on AI's impoact on work practices,
        the benefits of hybrid intelligence, digital transformation
        recommendations, and the ethical challenges posed by AI systems.

        2.0 The Changing Landscape of Business Strategy Consulting
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-blue-100 mb-4">
        Business strategy consulting is undergoing a transformation spurred by
        advancements in AI. Traditional consulting methods are giving way to
        hybrid approaches, where human expertise in strategy is complemented by
        machine-driven analysis and automation. This transition is driven by
        several key factors:

          Modern AI systems, exemplified by ChatGPT are capable of understanding
          and generating human-like language with remarkable clarity. This
          capability helps reduce communication costs and speeds up information
          processing in decision-making.<sup>1</sup>

            AI applications are no longer limited to simple tasks: they now
            support complex problem solving and even code generation, thereby
            allowing consultants to focus on strategic issues rather than
            routine operations.

            As consulting firms strive to remain competitive in the digital era,
            they must embrace transformation by integrating customizable AI
            solutions. Recommendations for digital transformation suggest that
            firms "own the change", commit organization-wide, and start small by

      <p className="text-lg text-blue-100 mb-4">
        The advent of AI has created an urgent need for consulting firms to
        reimagine their operational models. Upskilling agents in prompt
        engineering represents a strategic investment that not only enhances the
        quality and efficiency of consulting services but also safeguards
        against the risks of de-skilling and ethical oversights. In summary, the
        key insights drawn from this research are:
