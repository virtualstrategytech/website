# Project Context (for Copilot)

- Stack: Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind.
- Goal (branch `site-structure`): simplify IA for Virtual Strategy Tech.
- Top-level nav: About | Services (rename to Products) | Solutions | **Use Cases** | Demo
- Products should have Upskilling with subsections for NovAIn agent
- New page: /use-cases with two subsections: **Research** and **Case Studies** (skeletons now).
- Keep animation gate (no heavy effects on preview/non-prod).
- Netlify deploy previews must build without PROD-only animation.
- Existing format and graphics must remain consistent throughout.
