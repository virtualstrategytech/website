# Project Context (for Copilot)

- Stack: Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind.
- Goal (branch `site-structure`): simplify IA for Virtual Strategy Tech.
- Top-level nav: About | Services (simplify)) | Solutions (rename to Products) | **Use Cases** | Demo
- New page: /use-cases with two subsections: **Research** and **Case Studies** (skeletons now).
- New page: /products with one subsection: UpskillingPro and nested underneath that place the first product - NovAIn Beta version
- Keep animation gate (no heavy effects on preview/non-prod).
- Netlify deploy previews must build without PROD-only animation.
